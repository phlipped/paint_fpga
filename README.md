# SETUP

Here are some vague commands that might be useful to get setup.
Overall, I think you should create a python3 virtualenv, and install migen into it
 - sudo apt install python3-pip
 - python3 -m pip install virtualenv
 - sudo apt-get install python3-venv
 - pip3 install wheel
 - pip3 install migen

# RUNNING
 - Run a .py script to generate a .v (verilog) file
 - Run a test.py scrip to generate a .vcd, which you can view using gtkwave
